# t6
t6 is an "oriented-Data" platform to connect physical Objects with timeseries DB.

## Where to start
The easiest starting point is the [Ideas List](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/projects/3) where you can find multiple `ready to start nice feature requests`.
Once done (including documentation, you can Pull Request to master. :-)

## Contributing to t6
No specific rules. I'm not a developer myself!
I'd suggest first to clone and install the IoT platform on your machine. And then contact us : author email on the package.json file :-)
