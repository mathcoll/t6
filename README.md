## IoT and Physical World
Physical World are composed by your sensors and actuators, real physical Objects.
In _t6_, physical Objects needs* a virtual _[Object](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/wiki/Object)_ as a reference in _t6_ and then, they are able to add _Data_ to _[Flows](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/wiki/Flow)_.

_*_ : remain optional

Sample nodeMCU and Arduino scripts are available in the [sensors repository](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/tree/master/sensors) and on [t6iot Arduino library](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6iot).

## t6 API first: Live, eat, and breathe the API-first lifestyle of t6
Detailed [Api documentation](https://doc.internetcollaboratif.info) will help you to connect your sensors to _t6_.
Installing _t6_ on your own server is easy, follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/mathcoll/t6/wiki/Installing-t6) on Wiki page.
More detailed explanation on [![wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/t6%20documentation-orange)](https://www.internetcollaboratif.info/features/) is also available.

## t6 Android Application
_t6_ is available on the [Android Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.internetcollaboratif.api) for free.
This Application is using exactly the same code and Api from this repository.
